# IX-Supports

🧩 Prototyping + Motion + UX Powerhouse — Cross-platform desktop app for UI/UX designers.

IX-Supports is an open-source desktop application designed to empower UX/UI designers with a unified tool for high-fidelity prototyping, advanced animation, motion design, interaction flows, and export capabilities.

This app draws inspiration from tools like Principle, ProtoPie, Framer, and LottieFiles — and merges their core power into one elegant, blazing-fast experience for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
